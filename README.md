Airport
=======

This was a test for makers academy - week 3.

It was focused on us learning object orientated programming and test driven development.

The aim was to build a simple system in ruby (with tests written first in Rspec) that could:

 - Allow planes to land and take-off
 - Track the number of planes at the airport and on the runway
 - Take account of the weather (stormy or sunny)
 - Weather can switch state at random
 - The airport could have a bomb scare (and call it off).
